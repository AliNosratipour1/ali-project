<p>Gorden Kaye - the star of long-running World War II sitcom Allo Allo! - has died, aged 75.
Kaye starred as Rene Artois in all 84 episodes of the BBC series, which ran between 1982 and 1992, and returned for a one-off special in 2007.
He also appeared in more than 1,000 performances of the stage version of the comedy, which was set in a cafe in Nazi-occupied France.
Kaye's cafe owner and reluctant resistance figure became a much-loved comedy character.</p>

<p>In the show, he risked his life to aid the French resistance and stay clear of occupying Germans, while fending off suspicion from his wife Edith, played by Carmen Silvera.
A long-running joke had Rene hiding a painting called The Fallen Madonna With The Big Boobies, inside a sausage.
Former co-star Vicki Michelle, who played Yvette Carte-Blanche in the show, said it was a privilege to work alongside Kaye.</p>

<p>She told Sky News: "He was just an amazing actor, and he brought Rene to life and it was a privilege to have worked with him for 10 years.
"I think when you're working with people... they become part of your family, and I learnt so much from him, I learnt all of his little nuances when he was performing, the way he worked the camera, when we did stage together.</p>

<p>"I learnt so much from him so I will be very grateful to Gordon. It was just such a shock to hear that he passed away."</p>
